## Handling Unused Components

When working with these components:

1. **Do not modify** these components as part of regular application updates
2. **Do not remove** without consulting the team
3. If you need to use one of these components, **remove the @deprecated tag** and update this document
4. **Review periodically** to determine if they should be removed from the codebase

## Review Process

Unused components should be reviewed every 6 months to determine if they should be:
- Removed from the codebase
- Updated and brought into active use
- Kept for reference
