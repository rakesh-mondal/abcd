# Component Clean-Up Plan

This document outlines the process for safely removing unused components from the Krutrim Cloud project.

## Verification Process

Before removing any component, complete the following verification steps:

1. **Search for imports:**
   \`\`\`bash
   grep -r "import.*ComponentName" ./
   grep -r "from.*ComponentName" ./
   \`\`\`

2. **Check for dynamic imports:**
   \`\`\`bash
   grep -r "dynamic.*ComponentName" ./
   grep -r "React.lazy.*ComponentName" ./
   \`\`\`

3. **Search for string references:**
   \`\`\`bash
   grep -r "\"ComponentName\"" ./
   \`\`\`

4. **Check build logs** to ensure the component isn't being used in a way that's not obvious from code searches.

5. **Consult with team members** to confirm the component isn't needed for ongoing or planned work.

## Removal Process

Once a component is confirmed to be unused and not needed for future development:

1. **Create a branch** specifically for removing the component:
   \`\`\`bash
   git checkout -b cleanup/remove-unused-components
   \`\`\`

2. **Remove the component file:**
   \`\`\`bash
   git rm path/to/component.tsx
   \`\`\`

3. **Remove any associated test files:**
   \`\`\`bash
   git rm path/to/component.test.tsx
   \`\`\`

4. **Remove any associated documentation** or update documentation to reflect the removal.

5. **Run tests** to ensure nothing breaks:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

6. **Build the project** to ensure there are no build errors:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run build
   \`\`\`

7. **Create a pull request** with a clear description of what was removed and why.

## Components to Consider for Removal

The following components have been identified as potentially unused:

1. `components/auth/github-auth-screen.tsx`
2. `components/auth/google-auth-screen.tsx`
3. `components/billing/credits-display.tsx`
4. `components/icons/translate-icon.tsx`

Each component should go through the verification process before removal.

## Post-Removal Verification

After removing components:

1. **Verify the application builds successfully**
2. **Run all tests to ensure nothing breaks**
3. **Check key functionality manually** to ensure the application works as expected
4. **Monitor error reporting** after deployment to catch any runtime issues
