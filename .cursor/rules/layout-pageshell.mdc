# Layout and PageShell Rule

All main pages must use the [PageShell](mdc:components/page-shell.tsx) component to provide consistent layout, including title, description, and tab navigation. PageShell ensures adherence to the app's design system (Open Sauce One font, spacing, theming).

- Always wrap page content in PageShell.
- Use the `tabs` prop for tabbed navigation (see CPU Virtual Machines and Block Storage for reference).
- Do not override global font, spacing, or theme.
- See [components/page-shell.tsx](mdc:components/page-shell.tsx) for implementation.
