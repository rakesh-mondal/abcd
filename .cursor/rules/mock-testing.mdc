# Mock Data and Testing Rule

- Use mock data files (e.g., [lib/data.ts](mdc:lib/data.ts)) for resource tables/lists in development and testing.
- Mock data should match the structure of production data for easy replacement.
- When writing tests, use the same data shape and UI components as in production code.
- Do not hardcode test data in components; import from mock data files.
