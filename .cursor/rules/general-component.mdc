# General Component Rule

- All UI components must use shadcn/ui or the design system primitives unless there is a documented exception.
- No custom or third-party UI components for standard elements (button, modal, table, dropdown, etc.).
- Any exception must be documented and approved by the design team.

## Next.js App Router: Client/Server Component Rules

- Default to Server Components for all files in the `app/` directory.
- Use `"use client"` **only** when you need client-side interactivity (hooks, event handlers, browser APIs).
- Isolate client-side logic (like sorting, modals, forms, etc.) into small, reusable Client Components (e.g., `DataTable`).
- Page files (`page.tsx`) should be Server Components unless they need client-side features. Prefer importing Client Components for interactive parts.
- Client Components must be placed in `components/` and marked with `"use client"` at the top.
- Server Components can import other Server Components and Client Components, but Client Components can only import other Client Components.
- For any UI pattern that needs state or interactivity (tables, modals, dropdowns, etc.), create a dedicated Client Component.
- If you see the error about hooks in a Server Component, check your imports and hooks usage.
