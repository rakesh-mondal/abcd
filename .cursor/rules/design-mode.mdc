# Design Mode Rule

We are in design mode. We're not going to be building any backend functionality. We're just going to use dummy JSON in order to mock up the prototype of our application.

## Guidelines:
- Focus on UI/UX prototype development only
- Use dummy JSON data for all data requirements
- Mock all API responses and backend interactions
- Prioritize visual design and user experience over functional implementation
- Create realistic but static data representations
- Use mock data files (e.g., [lib/data.ts](mdc:lib/data.ts)) for consistent data structure
- Avoid implementing actual database connections, API calls, or server-side logic
- Simulate user flows and interactions with static responses
