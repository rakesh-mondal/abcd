# StatusBadge and ActionMenu Rule

- Use [StatusBadge](mdc:components/status-badge.tsx) to display resource status in tables/lists.
- Use [ActionMenu](mdc:components/action-menu.tsx) for row actions (view, edit, delete, etc.).
- Do not implement custom status or action UI; always use these components for consistency.
