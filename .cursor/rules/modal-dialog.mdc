# Modal/Dialog Rule

- Use only [shadcn/ui Dialog primitives](mdc:components/ui/dialog.tsx) for all modal dialogs.
- Do not use custom modal HTML or any third-party modal libraries.
- All modal content and actions (buttons, forms) must use the design system components (Button, Input, etc.).
- Modals must be accessible and follow shadcn/ui design standards.
